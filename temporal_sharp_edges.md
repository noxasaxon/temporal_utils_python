# Temporal Sharp Edges → Automated Best Practices


|  | Sharp Edge | Best Practice | Code Review Tips | Current Attempt To Automate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Inputs & Outputs: adding or removing parameters to a WF’s or ACT’s input or output can break the workflow by causing a nondeterminism error. | use a single dict-like argument that holds all of the WF or ACT’s inputs. | Make sure all activity inputs and outputs take a single argument + make sure that argument is a dict + make sure the dict doesnt have fields renamed or deleted, only added to. To remove a field, set it as optional None and = None by default  | Write activities in a Class that inherits from BaseValidated. That will automatically check any method with the @activity decorator and make sure it has a single input and output |
| 2 | Inputs & Outputs: Temporal needs inputs and outputs to be serializiable, default is JSON. Dataclasses work out of the box, but aren’t good at serializing complex data structures which will throw runtime errors. | Use pydantic! + Have your input and outputs be a class that inherits from BaseModel + Use a custom temporal data_converter that uses pydantic instead of the default JSON | make sure the activity inputs and outputs inherit from Basemodel + make sure they aren’t decorated with dataclass too (this breaks the converter right now) |  |
| 3 | wf imports: workflow files need to be deterministic; when importing modules python evaluates all the code and it may hit block-listed packages even though we’re not running the code directly | in workflow files, import all code via the sandbox (this can be easy to mess up because vscode’s auto import will put it at the top of the file, outside the sandbox context provider indentation) | check all the imports in the workflow file, usually you should only see `from temporalio import workflow` outside the sandbox indent | TBD |
